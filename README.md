# Face Recognition Project

* In this project custom Machine Learning models for Face Recognition and Emotion Classification is made and tested to achieve good accuracy.
* This project is carried on the dataset generated by our class. (For more information read report).
* The iPython notebooks are intended to run in Google colab.
* The models are also saved in files, so it can be loaded and used.
* The model structure and some hints from the code might be helpful to some of you.
* Files `facenet_weights.h5` `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` `emotion_cnn_clf.h5` are not included in the repo as the file size was larger than github limit, please google it out to find these files.
